This project demonstrates fine-tuning and deployment of Microsoft's Florence-2 multimodal model for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. The system allows users to upload an image, ask questions about it, and receive AI-generated answers with confidence scores.

## 📌 Live Demo

Try the live application on Hugging Face Spaces:

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Fine-tuning** the Florence-2 model on the Abstract Scenes subset of the VQA v2.0 dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the dataset
3. **Web Application** development using Streamlit for real-time inference
4. **Model Deployment** on Hugging Face Spaces


## 🔧 Technical Components

- **Model**: Microsoft Florence-2 (multimodal vision-language model)
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom training loop with PyTorch
- **Dataset**: VQA v2.0 [Abstract Scenes](https://visualqa.org/)
- **Front-end**: Streamlit web application
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces

## 📊 Dataset

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset v2.0 was used for training, which consists of:
- Open-ended questions about images
- Multiple possible answers for each question
- Abstract scenes subset (cartoon-like images)

Sample analysis of the dataset:
- Over 30,000 questions and images
- Question types include "what is", "how many", "is there", etc.
- Answer distribution analysis showed common responses

## 🚀 Model Fine-tuning

The Florence-2 model was fine-tuned using:
- Custom PyTorch training loop
- AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 1e-5
- 3 training epochs
- Beam search for inference
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

The training workflow is documented in the `florence_2_finetuned_vqa_dataset.ipynb` notebook.

## 📱 Web Application

The Streamlit web application provides:
- Image upload functionality
- Interactive question input
- Model inference with confidence scores
- Session history tracking
- Results download capability

## 🔍 Results

The fine-tuned model shows strong performance on the VQA task:
- Improved accuracy compared to the base model
- Quick response time for real-time applications
- Ability to handle various question types and image scenarios

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

> **Note**: The application is already deployed online at [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/parhamaki/data_mining_project). The following instructions are only necessary if you want to run the application locally for development or testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for faster inference)

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alirezakhoshsolat/florence2-vqa.git
cd florence2-vqa
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the fine-tuned model:
```bash
# Using the provided script
python scripts/download_model.py

# Or directly from Hugging Face
huggingface-cli download parhamaki/data_mining_project/florence2_finetuned_model --local-dir ./models/florence2_finetuned_model
```

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your web browser to use the application.

### Quick Setup

Alternatively, you can use the provided setup script which automates the installation process:

```bash
# Run the setup script
python setup.py

# Or with options
python setup.py --no-download  # Skip model download
python setup.py --install-only  # Don't launch the app
```

This script will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, download the model, and launch the application automatically.
